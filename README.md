## How a Caesar Cipher Works & What it is

* Caesar Cipher is also known as a shift cipher was made by Julius Caesar more info can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

* It is a simple but widely known encryption technique

* A Caesar cipher is used to replace each letter with a different one based on the shift in the alphabet

* As an example if we wanted to used the cipher on the letter 'A' and use a shift 3 it would become 'D'.

* NOTE: This is a insecure way to encrypt userdata as it can easily be bruteforced.
